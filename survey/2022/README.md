# The Package Manager Security Landscape Survey

In 2022, the OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group embarked on
an effort to survey the current security landscape of package manager
ecosystems.

This effort provides a survey/landscape of different security mechanisms and
features that are implemented across the different ecosystems as it pertains to
security critical user journeys. The goal of this exercise is to understand
overall security priorities, and to cross-pollinate ideas, threat models and
designs across the ecosystems. 

The survey covers 3 main broad topics: Secure, Ingest and
Evaluate. This includes areas of:
- Integrity
- Typos & dependency confusion
- Handling compromise and malice
- Portecting the ecosystem
- Auth and credential Management
- Policy
- SBOMs
- Identifying and producing good depdencies
