# The Package Manager Security Landscape Survey

In 2022, the OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group embarked on
an effort to survey the current security landscape of package manager
ecosystems.

This effort provides a survey/landscape of different security mechanisms and
features that are implemented across the different ecosystems as they pertain to
security critical user journeys. The goal of this exercise is to understand
overall security priorities, and to cross-pollinate ideas, threat models and
designs across the ecosystems. 

The survey covers the following topics:
- Integrity
- Typos and dependency confusion
- Handling compromise and malice
- Protecting the ecosystem
- Authentication and credential management
- Policy
- SBOMs
- Identifying and producing good dependencies

## Survey Summary

As of 31st December 2022, the working group looked at the results and created a
